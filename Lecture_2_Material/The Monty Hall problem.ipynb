    "A contestant and a host are at a place that gives access to three rooms, whose doors are all closed before the game starts. A car is in one room, a goat in another, while the third room is empty. The host knows what is in each room, while the contestant doesn't. The contestant is asked to chose one of the doors. Following that choice, the host opens another door, which is that of a room that does not contain the car. The contestant is then asked to either stick to his choice or \"switch\", that is, choose the third door (e.g., the door which is neither the one he chose in the first place nor the one that the host opened). The host opens the door as requested by the contestant, who wins what is in the room, if anything. The question is: what is the contestant's best strategy -- to switch or not to switch?\n",

So in both cases, the second door that the host opens following the decision of the contestant to switch is that of the room that contains the car. Hence by switching, the contestant has two chances out of three to win.\n",

By default, if the user requests to play at most 6 games, then the details of each game (which door the contestant choses in the first place, which door the host opens first, and which door he opens next that determines the outcome of the game), will be output; if the user requests more games to be played, then the details of the first 6 games only will be output. It should be possible to set the default of 6 to another value. In any case, the percentage of times the contestant won the game should be eventually displayed.\n",
