For instance, the first element ends up as the last element, moving from position (index) 0 and eventually ending up at position (index) $2n+1$.

At the end of each of the following stages, the algorithm permutes the element currently at position 0 with the element currently at position $2n+2$, that is, the element at position 0 at the end of previous stage. Hence as illustrated in the diagram, move to position $2n+2$: first $2n-1$ replaced by $2n+2$, then $2n-2$ replaced by $2n-1$, ..., then 2 replaced by 3, then 1 replaced by 2, then $2n$ replaced by 1, then $2n+1$ replaced by $2n$, and eventually 0 replaced by $2n+1$. Finally, all permutations of the numbers then at position 0, ..., $2n+1$ (those numbers being  1, 2, ..., $2n+2$) are generated, corresponding to a last, $(2n+2)$nd rotation in the following diagram, hence rotation following a \"full circle\".

It is not enough to know the last exchange, if some took place already.
