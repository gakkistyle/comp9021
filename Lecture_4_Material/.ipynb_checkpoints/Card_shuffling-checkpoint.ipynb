If both stacks have the same number of cards, then there is an equal chance that either the card at the bottom of stack 1 or the card at the bottom of stack 2 becomes the card at the bottom of the shuffled deck. The larger one stack is compared to the other stack, the higher the chance that the bottom card in the shuffled deck comes from the former. If there are $p$ cards in stack 1 and $q$ cards in stack 2, a good formalisation gives a $\\frac{p}{p+q}$ probability for the bottom card in the shuffled deck to come from the bottom of stack 1.

The same reasoning applies to determine which card becomes the second bottommost card in the shuffled deck, which decreases either $p$ or $q$ by 1, and which card becomes the third bottommost card in the shuffled deck, which decreases either $p$ or $q$ by 1... until one of both stacks becomes empty -- stack 1 if $p$ becomes equal to 0 first, stack 2 if $q$ becomes equal to 0 first.

    "`shuffled_deck` starts as an empty list, which a new element is appended to 56 times. An alternative would have been to initialise `shuffled_deck` to `[None] * nb_of_cards`, introduce a new variable `j` initialised to `0`, and change the statements `shuffled_deck.append(deck[i])` with `i_1` or `i_2` for `i` to the two statements `shuffled_deck[j] = deck[i]; j += 1`. Creating an empty list and appending an element to this list $n$ times is not obviously more efficient than creating a list of size $n$ with a default value and changing each of its $n$ elements to the desired value. Indeed, the size of a list $L$ is not the same as its length: a list can possibly accomodate more elements than it currently \"officially\" has. When $L$ is full, that is, when the size and the length of $L$ are the same, `append()` does not necessarily just provide space for one extra element, but possibly space for many elements, and all the more space that the list is longer. So when appending elements again and again, times when the list is full and needs to be expanded to accomodate more elements come less and less frequently, in a way that the __amortised cost__ of `append()` is constant: when the list is full and needs to be expanded and possibly copied over, the cost can be high, but the average cost over a large number of `append()` operations is constant. We can know the size of a list thanks to the function `getsizeof()` from the `sys` module. The following plot illustrates how the size of a list $L$ remains constant and suddenly jumps as elements are appended to $L$ one by one:"
