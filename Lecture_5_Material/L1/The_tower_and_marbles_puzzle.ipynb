    "In order to test the quality of the products of a marble manufacturer, one plans to drop marbles from various levels of a tower and see whether they break. We make the following assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If a marble breaks when dropped from a given level, then it would have broken if dropped from a higher level.\n",
    "* All marbles are of the same quality: they all break or all do not break if dropped from a given level.\n",
    "\n",
    "One intends to find out the highest level $L$ such that a marble dropped from level $L$ does not break, but breaks if dropped from a higher level, if any. The aim is to minimise the effort, that is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* find out the maximum number of drops $d$ needed in the worst case to get the correct answer;\n",
    "* come up with a strategy to, for any marble quality, get the correct answer with no more than $d$ drops.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem has two parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the number of available marbles, $m$;\n",
    "* the number of levels, $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both $m$ and $n$ are assumed to be nonnegative integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is straightforward if $m$ is equal to 1. Then $d$ is equal to $n$ and the only valid strategy consists in dropping the unique marble from level 1, then from level 2, then from level 3... until it breaks, if it ever does. The maximum of $n$ drops is needed if the marbles are of the best quality and do not break when dropped from any level, or if they are of the next best quality and break when dropped from the highest level, but not from any level below.\n",
    "\n",
    "There exists a general solution for any value of $m$, but a simpler solution exists in case $m$ is equal to 2; before describing and implementing the former, we describe and implement the latter. So for now, we set the value of $m$ to 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than directly computing $d$ from $n$, we reverse the problem: given $d$, what is the maximum number of levels $n$ (the maximum height of the tower) such that for any marble quality, one is sure to correctly assess the marbles' quality with no more than $d$ drops? If the first marble ever breaks, dropped from level $L$, one is left with the second marble only and has no other option but explore all levels below $L$, if any, starting with the lowest such level, and making one's way up on all unexplored levels below $L$.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  This means that the first drop should be from level $d$: if the marble breaks, then there are $d-1$ drops left and the second marble has to be dropped from level 1, then from level 2... potentially up to level $d-1$ (in case the lowest level from which marbles break is either level $d$ or level $d-1$). It is best to make the first drop from as high as possible, so the first drop should be made from level $d$.\n",
    "* The same reasoning shows that in case the first marble does not break following the first drop, it should then be dropped from level $d+(d-1)$: if it breaks, then there are $d-2$ drops left and there are $d-2$ unexplored levels between level $d$, the highest level $L$ for which it is known that a marble dropped from $L$ does not break, and level $d+(d-1)$, the lowest level $L'$ for which it is known that a marble dropped from $L'$ does break. The second marble should be dropped from level $d+1$, then from level $d+2$... potentially up to level $2d-2$ (in case the lowest level from which marbles break is either level $2d-1$ or level $2d-2$).\n",
    "* If following the second drop, the first marble does not break, the third drop should be from level $d+(d-1)+(d-2)$.\n",
    "* ...\n",
    "* In case marbles are of the best quality and never break, the first marble only will be used, dropped from level $d$, then from level $d+(d-1)$, then from level $d+(d-1)+(d-2)$... and eventually, for the $d$th drop, from level $d+(d-1)+(d-2)+\\dots+2+1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows that $n$ is equal to $\\frac{d(d+1)}{2}$; $n$ and $d$ satisfy the equality $d^2+d-2n=0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, only some nonnegative integers $n$ are of the form $\\frac{d(d+1)}{2}$ for some nonnegative integers $d$. In the original problem, $n$ is known and arbitrary, while $d$ has to be computed from $n$. We infer from the previous considerations that $d$ is the smallest nonnegative integer such that $d^2+d-2n\\geq 0$, hence $d=\\lceil\\frac{-1+\\sqrt{1+8n}}{2}\\rceil$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assume that $n=6$; then $d=3$. The first drop should be from level 3, and if the marble does not break, the second drop should be from level $3+2=5$, and if the marble still does not break, the third drop should be from level $3+2+1=6$.\n",
    "* Assume that $n=5$; then $d=3$ too. The first drop should be from level 3, and if the marble does not break, the second drop should be from level $3+2=5$, and if the marble does not break, we are done, as there is no higher level to explore.\n",
    "* Assume that $n=4$; then $d=3$ still. The first drop should be from level 3. If the marble does not break, the second drop could afford to be from level $3+2=5$, but since there is no such level, it should be from level 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "This illustrates that given $i$ between 1 and $d$, there can only be an $i$th drop with the first marble in case $n$ is at least equal to $1+\\Sigma_{j=0}^{i-2}(d-j)$, and if there is an $i$th drop with the first marble, then it should be from level $\\min(n, \\Sigma_{j=0}^{i-1}(d-j))$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define a variable, `breaking_level`, meant to denote the value of the lowest level $L$ such that a marble dropped from $L$ breaks, if there is such a level. We should also allow for the case where the marble is of best quality and does not break when dropped from any level. To simplify the design of the solution, it is best to let $n+1$ be the corresponding value. One can think of $n+1$ to be an additional, \"virtual\" level, such that any marble dropped from that level is sure to break, which is consistent with the reasonable assumption that a marble is sure to break when dropped from high enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define two variables, `low` and `high`, meant to keep track of the highest level $L$ for which it is known that a marble does not break when dropped from level $L$, and of the lowest level $L'$ for which it is known that a marble does break when dropped from level $L'$, respectively. The initialisation should capture what we know before the procedure starts: `low` should be set to `0` and `high` to $n+1$. At any stage of the computation, `low` will be smaller than `high`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is some uncertainly for as long as there is a gap between `low` and `high`, so for as long as `low` is strictly smaller than `high - 1`. The next drop will then be from level $l$ for some $l$ strictly between `low` and `high`, raising the value of `low` to $l$ in case the marble does not break, decreasing the value of `high` to $l$ in case the marble breaks, in both cases, reducing the gap between `low` and `high`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* When using the first marble, the first drop should be $d$ levels above the current value of `low`, set to `0`, the second drop should be $d-1$ levels above the current value of `low`, changed to $d$ after the first drop, the third drop should be $d-2$ levels above the current value of `low`, changed to $d+(d-1)$ after the second drop... in each case unless the computed value is at least equal to the value of `high`, as it should then be set to `high - 1`.\n",
    "* When using the second marble, every drop should be 1 level above the current value of `low`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable `step` can keep track of by how many levels above the current value of `low` to go up for the next drop.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the last drop, `high` is equal to `low + 1`, and it is known that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* if `high` is equal to $n+1$, then marbles are of best quality and do not break;\n",
    "* if `high` is strictly smaller than $n+1$, then a marble breaks when dropped from level `high`, but not below.\n",

In contrast to `randrange()` which, like `range()`, excludes the upper bound provided as second argument, `randint()` does include the upper bound.

    "The simulation is very similar to the 2 marbles case.

Indeed:\n",
