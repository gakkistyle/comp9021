We then intend to compute clusters and new centroids stage by stage, until the centroids do not change, and display every new set of clusters; such is the purpose of function `plot_clusters()`, whose first argument is meant to denote a dictionary of the kind returned by `cluster_with()`, and whose second argument is meant to denote an axes's index. The purpose of `plot_clusters()` is to draw the points, using one colour per cluster, as well as the associated centroids, using a different shape but the same colour as that of the associated cluster. We limit the number of computation stages to 8 at most, so we use a grid of size 3 by 3, reserve the top left cell of the grid to display the points and original centroids before cluster computation starts, and use some of the 8 remaining cells to display the first and every new set of clusters and associated centres of gravity, starting with the middle cell on the top row, and moving left to right and top to bottom. We limit the number of original centroids to 10 at most, define a sequence of 10 colours, and let `iter()` return an iterator for this sequence so that `next()` can be called and yield a new colour for every new cluster. We set the range of $x$- and $y$-values to display along the $x$- and $y$ axes with `matplotlib.pyplot` `axis()` function. We use the default value of the keyword argument `marker` of `matplotlib.pyplot`'s `scatter()` function to draw the points as disks, while we change it to `'^'` to draw the centres of gravity as triangles; the `c` keyword argument can be made more explicit as `color`. Calling `plot_clusters()` only once does not show how the axes is positioned on a grid of size 3 by 3:"
