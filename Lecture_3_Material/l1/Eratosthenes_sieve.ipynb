    "Let $n$ be a natural number. If a natural number $m$ at most equal to $n$ is not prime then $m$ is of the form $p_1\\times\\dots\\times p_k$ for some $k\\geq 2$ and prime numbers $p_1$, ..., $p_k$ with $p_1\\leq\\dots\\leq p_k$; hence $n\\geq m\\geq p_1^2$, hence $p_1\\leq\\sqrt n$. This implies that all natural numbers at most equal to $n$ that are not prime have a proper factor at most equal to $\\lfloor\\sqrt n\\rfloor$. So to identify all prime numbers up to and possibly including $n$, it suffices to cross out, from the collection of all numbers between 2 and $n$, all proper multiples at most equal to $n$ of 2, 3, ... up to and including $\\lfloor\\sqrt n\\rfloor$. Moreover, given a number $p$ at most equal to $\\lfloor\\sqrt n\\rfloor$, if all proper multiples at most equal to $n$ of all numbers greater than 1 and smaller than $p$ have been crossed out, then either $p$ has been crossed out (together with all its multiples at most equal to $n$, case in which $p$ is not prime), or only its proper multiples at least equal to $p^2$ and at most equal to $n$ remain to be crossed out (case in which $p$ is prime).\n",

    "To display all prime numbers at most equal to $n$, we define two functions. One function, `sequence_and_max_size_from()`, is designed to, from the list returned by `sieve_of_primes_up_to()`, determine and return the corresponding sequence of primes $\\sigma$ together with the number of digits $l$ in the last (and largest) prime in the sequence; $\\sigma$ and $l$ will be assigned to both arguments, `sequence` and `max_size`, respectively, of the other function, `nicely_display()`. We will utilise this function again when we implement other sieve methods. It is general enough to nicely display any sequence of data all of which are output with at most `max_size` many characters. More precisely, `nicely_display()` has the following features. It outputs at most 80 characters per line. Two spaces precede the display of the data that are output with `max_size` many characters. Three spaces precede the display of the data that are output with `max_size` minus 1 many characters, if any. Four spaces precede the display of the data that are output with `max_size` minus 2 many digits, if any... That way, all data will be nicely aligned column by column, with the guarantee that at least two spaces will separate two consecutive data on the same line. If $l$ is the value of `max_size`, then exactly $\\lfloor\\frac{80}{l+2}\\rfloor$ data will be displayed per line, with the possible exception of the last line:"

So the argument `sequence` of `nicely_display()` can be either an iterable that is not an iterator, like a list, or a tuple; or it can be an iterator, like a generator expression. The second option can lead to more effective code than the first one. Indeed, when a `for` statement processes a list or tuple, then that list or tuple had to be created in the first place, which the `for` statement then processes by implicit calls to `next()` on an iterator produced from that list or tuple by `iter()`. On the other hand, when a `for` statement processes a generator expression, then only a mechanism to produce a sequence had to be created in the first place, and that mechanism is activated (`next()` is implicitly called again and again) to generate all elements in the sequence and process them \"on the fly\": "

    "To display all prime numbers at most equal to $n$ from the list returned by `optimised_sieve_of_primes_up_to()`, we need to adapt the function `sequence_and_max_size_from()`. Essentially, one has to generate all numbers of the form $2i+1$ for all $1\\leq i\\leq\\lfloor\\frac{n - 1}{2}\\rfloor$ such that the list `sieve` returned by `optimised_sieve_of_primes_up_to()` has a value of `True` at index $i$; such is the relationship between the odd prime numbers at most equal to $n$ and the strictly positive indexes in `sieve`. But these odd prime numbers have to be preceded with 2. We still want to return an iterator. The simplest solution is to create an iterator from an iterator meant to generate 2 only, and the generator expression `(2 * p + 1 for p in range(1, len(sieve)) if sieve[p]))`. The `chain()` function from the `itertools` module lets us combine a sequence of iterables (some of which can be iterators) into one iterator:"
