Moreover, given a number $p$ at most equal to $\\lfloor\\sqrt n\\rfloor$, if all proper multiples at most equal to $n$ of all numbers greater than 1 and smaller than $p$ have been crossed out, then either $p$ has been crossed out (together with all its multiples at most equal to $n$, case in which $p$ is not prime), or only its proper multiples at least equal to $p^2$ and at most equal to $n$ remain to be crossed out (case in which $p$ is prime).\n",

Three spaces precede the display of the data that are output with `max_size` minus 1 many characters, if any.

    "To save half of the sieve's space and not have to cross out the proper multiples of 2, one can change `sieve` and make it a list of length $\\lfloor\\frac{n + 1}{2}\\rfloor$, with indexes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... meant to refer to the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 9...  The price we pay for this is that we lose the simple equivalence between \"number $p$ is prime\" and \"`sieve` eventually stores `True` at index $p$\": the equivalence becomes: \"number $p$ is prime\" iff:\n",

    "Let $p$ be a number between 3 and $\\lfloor\\sqrt n\\rfloor$. The index that refers to $p$ in this modified `sieve` is $k=\\frac{p-1}{2}$, hence the index that refers to $p^2$ is $\\frac{p^2-1}{2}=\\frac{(p-1)(p+1)}{2}=\\frac{p-1}{2}2(\\frac{p-1}{2}+1)=2k(k+1)$. Also, only the proper odd multiples at most equal to $n$ of $p$ have to be crossed out; so after having crossed out such a multiple $a$, the next multiple of $p$ that needs to crossed out (in case it is still at most equal to $n$), is referred to at index $\\frac{a+2p-1}{2}=\\frac{a-1}{2}+p=\\frac{a-1}{2}+2k+1$, so $2k+1$ needs to be added to the index that refers to $a$ to refer to that next multiple of $p$.\n",

    "To display all prime numbers at most equal to $n$ from the list returned by `optimised_sieve_of_primes_up_to()`, we need to adapt the function `sequence_and_max_size_from()`. Essentially, one has to generate all numbers of the form $2i+1$ for all $1\\leq i\\leq\\lfloor\\frac{n - 1}{2}\\rfloor$ such that the list `sieve` returned by `optimised_sieve_of_primes_up_to()` has a value of `True` at index $i$; such is the relationship between the odd prime numbers at most equal to $n$ and the strictly positive indexes in `sieve`. But these odd prime numbers have to be preceded with 2. We still want to return an iterator. The simplest solution is to create an iterator from an iterator meant to generate 2 only, and the generator expression `(2 * p + 1 for p in range(1, len(sieve)) if sieve[p]))`. The `chain()` function from the `itertools` module lets us combine a sequence of iterables (some of which can be iterators) into one iterator:"
