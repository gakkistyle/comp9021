The population evolves in stages. At every stage:\n",

    "The previous implementation of the evolution of a population assumed that the game of life is played on a finite grid whose boundaries have their role in how life evolves; for instance, a cluster of living cell could bounce back on a grid boundary. As the comment in `gosperglidergun.rle` indicates, part of the interest in the game of life has been to find patterns \"with unbounded growth\". To be faithful to the interpretation of the game where the grid is not the whole universe, but only a finite window in an unbounded universe, we will create movies supposed to run for a predetermined number of generations, with a default value of 1,000 that the user will be able to change, but the movie will stop as soon as a living cell touches on the \"frame\" of the grid, if that happens before the movie is set to end:"
