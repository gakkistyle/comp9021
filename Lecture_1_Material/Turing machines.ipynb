    "A Turing Machine (TM) is an idealised model of a computer. Whereas real computers have finite memory, a TM has infinite memory, represented as a _tape_ of consecutive _cells_, each of which contains either the _symbol_ 0 or the symbol 1, that extends infinitely both left and right. To represent a finite section of the tape of a TM, a particular kind of __object__, namely, a Python __list__, is appropriate. We just need to define a Python list whose elements are the __integers__ 0 and 1, that Python also represents as objects. We can then let a __variable__, say `tape`, denote what the list __literal__ `[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]` itself denotes, namely, a sequence of bits stored in computer memory meant to be interpreted as the Python list that consists of the integers 0, 0, 1, 1, 1 and 0. This is a particular kind of __statement__: an __assignment__. It involves two __expressions__: the list literal and the variable, the list literal itself  involving many occurrences of two expressions: `0` and `1`. Expressions are to be __evaluated__; the result of the evaluation is a mathematical entity, the expression's __value__. Statements are to be __executed__. In the following cell, on the line that precedes the statement `tape = [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]` and on the line of that statement, following it, are two __comments__. When running the cell, `tape = [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]` is executed. Then `tape` is evaluated and a \"standard\" expression is output whose value is the same as `tape`'s value; that expression happens to be the list literal that `tape` has been assigned to:"

A TM does not have a global view of the tape, it only has a very local view, that of a single cell, but the contents of that cell changes over time as the TM moves its head left or right. A TM also has a _program_ to perform some computation. We assume that before computation starts, the tape has been \"initialised\" in such a way that only a finite number of cells contain the symbol 1, some cell contains 1, and the head is positioned below the cell that contains the leftmost 1.

A TM is _deterministic_. This means that at any stage, at most one instruction can be executed: its program does not have two distinct instructions that both start with the same first two elements, with the same state and symbol.
