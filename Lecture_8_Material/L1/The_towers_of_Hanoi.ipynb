    "Rather than displaying instructions on which disk to move from where to where, let us display the successive states of the three stacks starting with the initial configuration of the game, ending with the final configuration of the game, representing a disk of size $n$ as $2n-1$ successive hyphens. For this purpose, we could immediately adapt `iterative_towers()`, but let us rather adapt `recursive_towers()` to a similar function, `recursive_towers_variant()`, replacing the `print()` statements in `recursive_towers()` with calls to a function `display_move()`, which itself will call a function `display_towers()`. The function `display_move()` can know from `recursive_towers_variant()` from which stack the disk at the top should be popped, and to (the top of) which stack that disk should be moved at this stage of the game. Once the pop and move operations have been performed, `display_towers()` can display the three stacks. Working with 3 stacks, moving a disk from the top of one stack to the top of another stack, is what `iterative_towers()` implements, and we can borrow from that implementation. To let the stacks \"survive\" between successive calls to the functions, we could use global variables, but we can also make use of function parameters with lists as default values. The values of the default parameters can be manipuled thanks to the function's `__defaults__` attribute:"

The functions `recursive_towers_variant()`, `display_move()` and `display_towers()` can then be implemented as follows; they all take an extra argument, `w`, meant to denote the width of the largest disk, so that `display_towers()` knows how to center the disks that make up the stacks:"
